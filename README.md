# Linear-Regression-Tutorial

I'm learning Linear Regression by using sklearn libraries in Python.

What I've learned ? :

-
- Which libraries I need to use to build a Linear Regression model.
- How to convert the data types to data types that we need to use in model.
- Showing and understanding the interrelationship of the information on the dataset.
- Learned how plots can be used in real model project.
- Learned what the test_size, random_state variables do and how they should be resized.
- Learned what the metrics to measure the performance of the created model are, what these errors mean, and how the performance should be interpreted.
- I was able to write a linear regression function that manually inputs my own values ​​and generates the predicted value.
